# React Router v6 Nested Route Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using nested routes and parameters with React Router v6. The problem involves intermittent rendering failures of a component when navigating to a specific route path.

## Bug Description

The `User` component, which is accessed through a route with a parameter (`/users/:userId`), does not always render correctly. This appears to be related to the nesting of routes and the order in which they are defined. The issue occurs sporadically and seems to be dependent on specific route configurations.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/users/123` (or a similar path).  Observe that sometimes the User component renders correctly, other times it doesn't.

## Solution

A solution to this issue is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file.  The problem was solved by ensuring that the route with the parameter was placed higher up in the routes hierarchy. 

This might indicate an underlying issue with the React Router v6 library, possibly due to route prioritization or a race condition.
